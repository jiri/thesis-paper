Create an emulator of a simple processor instruction set which could be used by students familiarising themselves with assembly programming. Instruction set should be configurable so that students can familiarise themselves with assembly gradually. Instruction set should be similar to the AVR instruction set which students later work with. Emulator must enable basic debugging operations like stepping, watching and modifying memory content.
