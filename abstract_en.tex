This work focuses on the design and implementation of an assembler, emulator and a debugging application for an instruction set of a simple processor, which will enable beginners to orient themselves in the field of programming in the assembly language. It allows constraining of the instruction set for exercises, in which we want to demonstrate specific attributes of assembly programming.
